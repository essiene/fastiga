- Reorganize the code... under one main project,
  no need to have two projects nested

- Update the spec file, its still carrying konfirmagi settings

- Refactor the example app, pull out stuff into a utils class

- Review the Java Code and the parser... possibly reorg the
  file layout for library consistency

- tag us at v0.1 and push to github... any other thing
  will be done on github
